The program is an implementation of our sub-sampling time hidden Markov model (stHMM), for analysing single-molecule trajectories with sub-temporal resolution. It makes use of the nested sampling algorithm which allows for Bayesian model selection and parameter inference. Apart from accounting for sub-temporal state switches, we approximate the effects of localisation noise and motion blur.

The "parameter_inference" script generates and analyses a number of data-sets, each with a distinct mean number of state switches. These data-sets are then analysed with the standard HMM as well as the stHMM. The parameter inference results are then plotted and compared, in this case as posterior means with associated confidence intervals. Once the posterior distribution has been sampled (using the "nestedsampling" function), one can plot e.g. marginalised distributions of each parameter.
